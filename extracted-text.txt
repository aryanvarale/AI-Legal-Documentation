"Maybe it belongs to the old cottage up on the hill." Excited, Sarah and Bruno runned up the hill to the cottage, which was abandoned since many years. The door was stuck, but after trying a few times, the key turned and the door creaked open. Inside, dust and cobweb cover the furniture, but something sparkle in the corner. It was a small chest, and inside it was old letters, photographs, and some coins.
